# carelesswhisper 0.1.1  2023-06-17

* Added `details` option to `whisper()` to have it return a data.frame of details on
  tokens, rather than just the final text string.
    * Internal copy of [`{deft}`](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/deft) package for data.frame creation in C
* Added `jfk` audio sample for testing (copied from `whisper.cpp`)

# carelesswhisper 0.1.0

* Initial release
