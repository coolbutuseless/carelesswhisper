`carelesswhisper` is a (dependency-free!) package for recording audio and then
performing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) using [`whisper.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp).

This package includes the smallest multi-language `whisper.cpp` model (70MB) and it is possible to record audio and perform
speech recognition immediately after install (without chasing down any file downloads or dependencies).


## What's in the box

* `whisper_init()` and `whisper()` for interfacing with the built-in [`whisper.cpp`](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) code for speech recognition
* `record_audio()` will record audio from your default input device using the built-in 
  [`miniaudio`](https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio) C library.



## Installation

You can install from [GitHub](https://github.com/coolbutuseless/carelesswhisper) with:

``` r
# install.package('remotes')
remotes::install_github('coolbutuseless/carelesswhisper')
```

### Platform notes:

The audio recording in this package uses [`miniaudio`](https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio) - this is cross-platform and
should work on macOS, Windows and Linux.

However this package has only been tested on macOS so please let me know of
any issues.

No attempt has been made to choose good parameters for the compiler - so it
is not optimized for any particular platform.  This probably leaves a lot 
of speed on the table.


## Using `carelesswhisper`


```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(carelesswhisper)

# Initialise whisper with built-in model (tiny, multi-language)
ctx <- whisper_init()

# Record 2 seconds of audio and perform speech recognition
snd <- record_audio(2)
whisper(ctx, snd)

# Record 2 seconds of audio and perform speech recognition
# Tell whisper it should treat the audio as spoken Japanese
snd <- record_audio(2)
whisper(ctx, snd, language = 'ja')

# Ask whisper to translate the Japanese into English
whisper(ctx, snd, language = 'ja', translate = TRUE)
```


## Using different models

The model included with this package (and used by default when calling `whisper_init()`) 
is the smallest, multi-language model: `ggml-tiny.bin`.  

**Larger models** exist, but 
they need more RAM and run slower.

**English-only models** can perform better if English is the only language you 
expect to encounter.

If you want to use any of the different/more complex models, just 
download them and give the path to `whisper_init(path_to_model)`

These models can be downloaded from:

* [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/main)
* [ggerganov](https://ggml.ggerganov.com/)
